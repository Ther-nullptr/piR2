# Single-GPU S1/S2 execution tools

These are auxiliary GR00T inference and profiling tools. The current workload loads the SO100 replay checkpoint `outputs/pir2-so100-smoke/checkpoint-10` and real prerecorded SO100 observations. It is not the LIBERO closed-loop evaluator. Adapting an optimization to the repository's GR00T-N1.7-LIBERO main line requires validating the suite-specific input, action horizon, state, embodiment and task success separately.

The two workers run a real VLM (S2) and a rolling DiT action head (S1) on one physical GPU. Feature handoff uses completion events and reader leases. Optional fusion, static input handling and CUDA Graph variants are explicit A/B choices. Numerical checks restore a paired starting buffer and compare with the eager path; periodic replay also records deadlines and feature ages.

## Commands

Prepare the pinned GR00T source and GPU environment as described in [environment setup](../docs/environment.md). Run the separate SO100 demonstration training entrypoint only if you need this replay checkpoint. Select an idle GPU; the launcher performs a preflight occupancy check:

```bash
PIR2_GPU=0 bash scripts/run_single_gpu_baseline.sh measure
PIR2_GPU=0 bash scripts/run_single_gpu_baseline.sh runtime
PIR2_GPU=0 bash scripts/run_single_gpu_baseline.sh protocols
```

Run one command at a time. Use `PIR2_OUTPUT` for a new result directory. Trace modes require Nsight Systems on PATH or an explicit `PIR2_NSYS` executable. The `test_*_gpu.py` modules require CUDA and are opt-in; CI only runs timeline/launch-attribution accounting tests.

See [measurement definitions](../docs/coexecution.md). Raw JSON, plots, SQLite exports, logs and Nsight traces stay local. These tools do not by themselves demonstrate LIBERO accuracy, physical control stability, quantization quality or performance on another GPU.

## Measured LIBERO queue reports

`queue_report` is a separate offline consumer of real LIBERO closed-loop trace artifacts. It loads no model and launches no GPU work. Install Matplotlib for static exports, and make Node.js available for the optional illustrative queue-model comparison:

```bash
python -m coexecution.queue_report \
  --input .local/experiments/queue-scan \
  --output .local/experiments/queue-report
python -m pytest -q coexecution/test_queue_report.py
```

The input contains `layout/condition/{hardware.json,telemetry.jsonl,calibration.json,slow-warmup.json,episodes.jsonl,task*-episode*-trace.jsonl}`; a single condition directory also works. Each completed control window contributes to the report. The output includes a self-contained offline `index.html`, PNG/SVG capacity and hardware curves, representative per-condition trace plots, `summary.json`, `summary.csv`, complete replay data, and an explicitly labelled `simulation-comparison.json`. Smoke, clock-probe and profile conditions are excluded by default; `--include-diagnostics` enables diagnostic previews.

The viewer replays camera waiting/in-flight/latest-feature state, S1 host requests and completed results awaiting adoption, and committed/future/bootstrap/fallback action slots with their producing request. Real capacity is the reciprocal of the mean complete solo RPC duration, never inferred from a requested clock. Hardware summaries report effective per-role clocks from telemetry. Requested settings need not take effect equally on different GPUs.

Latency percentiles use requests admitted and completed within control windows. End-crossing requests remain censored; outputs targeting future control ticks are not expired. Energy integrates board-power samples only within each control window and reports NVML energy-counter differences and sample coverage separately. Board energy includes rendering or other work on those GPUs. Different success-terminated durations remain visible, along with paired initial-state hashes. Host RPC overlap does not establish CUDA kernel overlap, and selected episodes do not establish full-suite success. The embedded simulator is a separate illustrative reference, with explicit sharing assumptions and its original synthetic calibration/drain accounting.

### Feature consumption accounting

```bash
python -m coexecution.feature_usage \
  --report .local/experiments/queue-report/report-data.json \
  --output .local/experiments/feature-usage \
  --raw-root .local/experiments/queue-scan
```

The optional raw-root audit verifies published and consumed source identities against the original traces. Counts always use the actual feature sequence, never the nearest publication to an RPC timestamp: a request can hold an older snapshot while a new version arrives during installation. Outputs contain per-feature DiT reads, distinct directly executed producer requests, execution ticks, zero/one/multiple-read distributions and count-weighted valid-episode summaries. Bootstrap and right-censored final features are separate; unknown sources explicitly mark accounting incomplete. Direct execution does not represent all causal contributions through the neural rolling buffer.

Use `queue_report --no-figures` to export replay without Matplotlib. The optional Source Han webfont remains a separately downloaded local asset; generated reports inline it with its license when present.
